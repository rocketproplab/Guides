# Introduction to Python

Python is an object oriented programming language with easy-to-read syntax. It has become considerably prevalent in industry and academia today due to it's great documentation, community support, and the plethora of open-source libraries that enhance it's capabilities.

## Installing Python
Almost all of the python programs that we will be using for engineering purposes use some common libraries: <code>numpy, scipy, matplotlib</code>.
The standard python installation doesn't come with these libraries. Therefore, I recommend installing python using the "anaconda" distribution. This distribution comes with a bunch of useful libraries.
__Install the python 3 anaconda distribution [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)__

### Python 3 or Python 2
There are currently two major python versions which are in common use: python 3 and python 2. Code written for one version isn't necessarily compatible with the other. Therefore, RPL has decided to use python3 exclusively.

## Running Python
__Note: This part of the tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the command line. If you are not yet comfortable entering commands, look at the command line tutorials [here](../acronyms.md)__
Python is a scriptable language, meaning that you can enter code into a python terminal and immediately get feedback without having to compile. While useful for quick development, this feature is limited. Programs are generally written in <code>.py</code> files. On Windows, Mac, and Linux machines with python installed, these can be run using the following commands:

<code>python fileName.py</code>
<code>python3 fileName.py</code>
