# Radiation Effects
This folder has calculations and guides describing the types of radiation in space and their effects on spacecraft, with a focus on the effects on materials and electronics.
## Overview of Radiation Effects Engineering]
### Radiation Sources in Space
#### Galactic Cosmic Rays
#### Near Earth Radiation
##### Proton Belts
##### Electron Belts
#### Solar Radiation
##### Solar Energetic Particles
Released during solar flares. General Helium Ions
### Radiation Effects
__ELECTRONICS__
Generally speaking, the damage incurred in electronics from radiation is a result of energy deposition in the silicon dioxide layer of transistors.
_transient effects_
_permanent effects_
__MATERIALS__
#### Single Event Effect (SEE)
A single event effect results from a single energetic particle impacting a transistor.
##### Single Event Upset (SEU)
#### Total Ionizing Dose
#### Displacement Damage Dose
### Instrumentation
### Sensing
