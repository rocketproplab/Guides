# Club Registration and Principal Member Registration
This guide is written to help new principal members through the exhausting and testing process of registering as a principal member of an engineering organization at UCSD. This guide also compiles the knowledge regarding the maintaining the club's registration.

## Club Registration
The Rocket Propulsion Laboratory needs to be reregistered each year! New principal members should prioritize reregistration to ensure that there are no delays to projects or funding.

### Organization Type
RPL is currently registered as an [__educational organization__](https://students.ucsd.edu/student-life/involvement/organizations/onestop/requirements.html#Educational-organizations). The original intent with registering as an educational organization was to get around the need for a community advisor. Unfortunately, litigation analysis is requiring us to have an advisor who will sign off on all of our activities. The advisor must be either a faculty member or industry member.

### Constitution
The constitution _must_ have this snippet.

> Please copy & paste the following into your Constitution:

> “Executive Board does not have the sole authority to approve an activity, as that authority rests with the faculty/community advisor. STUDENT ORG NAME will comply with all COMPETITION OR PARENT ORGANIZATION NAME, Federal, and State safety requirements, and federal and state laws governing the manufacturing, use, and transportation of rockets, aeronautic and astronautic components/vehicles, as well as materials used to construct such components/vehicles. STUDENT ORG NAME will ensure members know applicable state and federal laws (including laws governing the transportation of materials used to construct rockets/aeronautic/astronautic components) and work in conjunction with safety personnel. Each team must designate a safety officer to evaluate risks and regulatory restrictions, then incorporate appropriate controls into design and activity plans that ensure maximum safety and full regulatory compliance for review and approval by the club’s faculty advisor. Use of hazardous materials (chemicals, flammable solvents, reactive materials, fuels, propellants, etc.) must be reviewed and approved by the club’s faculty advisor, or his/her department’s designee. In the event any chemicals or hazardous materials/equipment is used, members must abide by any best practices for the use of such chemicals or equipment, and should work under close supervision of those trained in the handling of chemicals/use of equipment. Members must also abide by departmental rules when using equipment belonging to that department. Transportation of hazardous chemicals, fuels, and/or machinery will be done by a licensed carrier. This organization is a registered student organization at University of California, San Diego, but not part of the University itself. UCSD STUDENT ORG NAME understands that the University does not assume legal liability for any of the organization’s activities”.

### Community Advisor
Registration requires a community advisor per the statement above. The community advisor is required to sign the ["Community Advisor Agreement"](https://students.ucsd.edu/_files/student-life/involvement/organizations/onestop/Community%20Advisor%20Signature.pdf).

## Principal Members

The university provides a [guide](https://students.ucsd.edu/student-life/involvement/organizations/register.html) to registering a student organization. The guide includes all the steps that are required for registering as a principal member as well, however they will also be listed here. Note: this guide may not always capture changes to the registration process.

A total of 4-8 principal members are required for the organization. Historically, 4 seems to work well, and I (Cameron) see no good reason to have more and add more bureaucracy.

[This page](https://students.ucsd.edu/student-life/involvement/organizations/onestop/principal-members.html) provides more information on the registration of principal members.

### Triton's Together
One time consuming part of the registration part is taking Triton's Together. Triton's Together schedule fills up quickly, particularly at the beginning of the academic year. Check the availability and register for Triton's Together [here](http://tritonstogether.ucsd.edu/).
