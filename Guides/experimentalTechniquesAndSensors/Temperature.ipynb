    "\n",
    "Thermocouples are temperature measurement devices that are formed with two dissimilar metals where the junction is the measurement element. The temperature at the thermocouple junction generates a voltage as a result of the __Seebeck Effect__.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get higher confidence in measurements, a thermopile can be constructed where the temperature is the average of the measurements made by each of the thermocouples.\n",

    "\n",
    "Measurements of voltage made with thermocouples can easily be related to temperature with the following relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta V = \\alpha (T - T_{ref}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\alpha$, the slope, is dependent on the type of thermocouple used, $T_ref$ is the reference temperature (generally $T_ref = 0$), and $T$ is the measured temperature."
