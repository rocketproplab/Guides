# New Member Rotation Program

New Members will participate in a year-long program to introduce them to basics of propulsion, structures, and avionics. The intention of this program is to allow new members to find a discipline which they are most interested in.

## Leadership

Two new member leads will be assigned to guide the new members through each of the projects.
