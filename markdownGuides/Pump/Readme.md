# Overview

Centrifugal Pumps are a complex project to make work, and as such one singular guide cannot be made to describe the process behind creating one.

Instead, begin by accessing the file "Pump+Calculations.ipynb" and follow the comments to go through initial calculations for blade and volute profiles.

Next, look at "Initial Blade Profile.docx" in order to create an initial blade profile that can be iterated, a tutorial for which will follow soon.
