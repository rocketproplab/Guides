## Values in Python

Values, such as <code>3.14, 'hello', 10</code>, etc., are one of the basic elements that python manipulates in programs.

In programming, it is significant to note how the program is storing these values. For example passing a large structure to a function is significantly more computationally expensive than passing a pointer.
