    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Launch ascent guidance, or boost-to-orbit is the phase of a mission in which a spacecraft targets a specific orbit from a launch pad or air-launch vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The launch-to-orbit problem can be broken up into to two primary flight phases; endoatmospheric and exoatmospheric. Historically, endoatmospheric guidance, typically the first stage of a launch vehicle, has been open loo. A suboptimal guidance law is precomputed and uploaded to the vehicle. Second stage, or exoatmospheric flight, has typically been closed loop and is computed using nonlinear programming with a close to optimal solution. I will go into more details for each of these phases below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Endoatmospheric Guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently no optimal endoatmospheric guidance laws (that I know of) used for launch vehicles. While in the thick parts of the atmosphere, the primary goal is to reduce aerodynamic loads to acceptable levels. For this reason, a slow gravity turn is employed with nearly zero angle of attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the typical open-loop process, guidance commands are generated offline, updated with day-of-launch wind data before alunch and loaded into the launch vehicle for use during the ascent through the atmosphere. [4]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exoatmospheric Guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the vehicle is out of the atmosphere, an optimal, closed-loop guidance law can take over."
